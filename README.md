# UshahidiVM

The Ushahidi Project ([*https://www.ushahidi.com*](https://www.ushahidi.com)) is an open-source crisis mapping web application. There are several software components hosted at [*https://github.com/ushahidi/*](https://github.com/ushahidi/) but two that are relevant are **platform** ([*https://github.com/ushahidi/platform*](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform)) and **platform-client** ([*https://github.com/ushahidi/platform-client*](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform-client)). The Ushahidi VM that you will be using already has both projects installed.
